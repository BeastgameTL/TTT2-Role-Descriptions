roledesc.description.traitor=Can buy unique equipment and weapons. Must take out all Innocents to win.
roledesc.description.innocent=No special abilities or weapons. Must take out all Traitors to win.
roledesc.description.detective=Has equipment to find out who the Traitors are.
roledesc.description.amnesiac=The Amnesiac is a new role that is looking to change to another in order to win. To do so, you will need to find a hint to his lost identity. Said hint can be found by confirming a dead players body. The Amnesiac will receive the role of the first player that they confirm that round. It has to be a confirmation (revealing who died and what team they were in) a simple inspection does not count! The Amnesiac changing their role will be announced to all players. Some additional features using TTT2s awesome and easy to use system have also been implemented. :)
roledesc.description.bodyguard=The BodyGuard is a special case. Once he Spawns, he will get a random Player dedicated for him to protect and is also in the same Team as this Player. He will get a message which also reveals the Role of the Player he needs to protect. BUT, the BodyGuard will NOT see the other Players in the Team he is (so as Traitor he will not see other Traitors). Also the Player he needs to protect will get a message that a Player is his BodyGuard. Goal is to protect the Player you are dedicated to.  If the Player you need to protect dies, you will get some damage (or die depending on the Convar settings below) and you will also get a new Player to protect.  If you damage the Person you should protect, he will get less damage and you will get much damage back (Depending on the convar settings below). If you somehow manage to kill the Person you need to protect, you will also die (Depending on the convar settings below).
roledesc.description.clairvoyant=The clairvoyant is an innocent that sees special roles. This includes all special inocent and traitor roles as well as all other special roles in the round. Special roles are all roles besides the normal innocent, traitor and detective. They don't see the special role, they only see if they have one or not. The amount of roles that the clairvoyant can see can be set with a convar.  Additionally in combination with the sidekick and the jester, they can kill the jester as the only player without receiving a penalty or triggering the jesters winstate! After their death, the jester will immedially respawn as a sidekick of the clairvoyant.
roledesc.description.cupid=Cupid starts the round with his crossbow. The crossbow will be invisible to other players. "Shooting" it only makes particles on Cupids end and lets two Players fall in love. Using Cupid's crossbow after someone already died will nullify the effect without warning to prevent abuse.Other than that Cupid is a standard Innocent.  Lovers: After falling in Love the Lovers get notified of their fate and their team and split all their damage between eachother! If a lover miraculously survives the damage split they will die of a broken heart in 5 seconds! When the lovers are in opposite Teams i.e. Innocent and Traitor they will form their own Team and win when everyone else is dead. They can also see their loved one through walls and get notified if their significant other died, before them leaving this world as themself.
roledesc.description.executioner=The Executioner is on the traitor team. They have a target, similar to the Hitman role. They deal extra damage to their target while dealing less damage to non-targets. If they kill a non-target, they won't get a new target for an amount of time that can be configured. 
roledesc.description.hitman=The hitman (known as dealer from Dhalucard) is a new traitor role that spawns with zero credits. Instead of being awarded with credits once a few players are dead, he has to fight for every credit really hard by killing his targets. If he kills his target, he will be instantly rewarded with a credit. If his target dies in another way, he will get nothing in return. In both cases however a new target is selected after the old one died.  If played in combination with TTTC, the hitman is also able to see the classes of all players in his scoreboard.
roledesc.description.infected=The infected plays in his own team and has to kill other players to infect them. Once they are killed, they will respawn after a few seconds and fight for your team. But the newly found supporters have to defend their host, because they will die once he gets killed. If there is a jester in this round, the infected is allowed to kill him. 
roledesc.description.jackal=The Jackal is a normal shoppingrole, comparable to the traitor. But instead of fighting in the traitor team against the innocent players, he does it while fighting in his own team. Since fighting alone is hard and waiting until everybody else is dead is no solution to this problem, his role comes with a twist: the sidekick. Shooting any player with a sidekickdeagle converts them to a sidekick of the jackal. If the shot is missed you can try again after a cooldown. It is your goal to eliminate all other teams and be the last team standing.  Obviously the sidekick has to be installed as well in order for this functionality to work.  Additionally when playing with the priest, the jackal is able to convert the whole brotherhood to sidekicks by shooting the priest with his sidekickdeagle.
roledesc.description.jester=The jester plays in his own team and it's his goal to get killed by someone. To help him triggering other players, he doesn't deal any damage. But he has to be careful. Shooting at people without dealing damage might reveal his role to them. Killing him triggers one of the several winstates you can choose from. By default the jester wins when he is killed, but he can't kill himself!
roledesc.description.marker=The marker plays in his own team and has the goal of marking other players with his fancy paintgun. Once he marked enough of them (by default 3/4 of all players except himself) he wins. Marked players get notified when they are marked, so they do know there's a marker active in this round (you can disable that). The marker can't win by killing people in fact by default he can't even deal any damage and he always looses when only he and maximal one other role is alive. Therefore he plays nicely alongside the jester, since then there are two roles that do not deal any damage, one of which should be killed and one shouldn't. If he's too slow with marking other players, he might be unable to mark enough of them. Once all markers are dead, all players are unmarked! Players that were marked but killed afterwards do not count to marked players.  Additionally the marker sees in a special UI element how many players he has to mark. And since this number is scaled by the number of players that are alive, he can get a sense of how many players are still alive. This gives him some interesting powers, but he should keep quiet about them because calling out that someone has died might reveal him. Marked players do not deal any damage at all to him and he wears a body armor to protect himself.  The marker spawns with a marker defi that allows him to revive dead players. Revived players keep their role but spawn as marked. Since nobody knows if he is a traitor, a survivalist or a marker he can confuse others really fast. 
roledesc.description.mesmerist=The Mesmerist is a traitor with a special defib that allows them to revive a dead player, brainwashing them into a traitor!
roledesc.description.necromancer=The necromancer is a shoppingrole that spawns with a special defibrillator. The amount of uses of said defibrillator is based on the amount of spawned players in the round. It's his goal to be the last player standing. But he needn't be alone. With the help of the defibrillator he is able to revive dead bodies that respawn as zombies that fight on his side. These zombies are slower than normal players and have only a deagle with seven shots. Once the deagle is empty, the zombie dies.
roledesc.description.occultist=The Occultist is an innocent and wins with them. But he's got a hidden ability: When his HP falls below 25, he will be brought back to life after his death. When he dies, his corpse will go up in flames and then he can rise up and walk out off the flames. Furthermore he is invinsible to fire. But he must be careful: Persons around his corpse will be notified about his revival. If the Occultist is one-shotted, the ritual will not take effect and he will remain in the realm of the dead. 
roledesc.description.pharaoh=The pharaoh plays in the innocent team. He spawns with a special item - the ankh. Upon placing the ankh in a strategic position, a random traitor gets converted to a graverobber and is now his personal adversary. The graverobber is still in the traitor team.  The ankh is a precious item. When the pharaoh dies, he will be once revived at the position of his ankh. However his adversary, the graverobber, is able to steal this artefact from him. He has to be careful to not draw any attention on himself or he might show his true role to the other players. If the ankh is in the posession of the graverobber, he gets revived instead of the pharaoh upon death.  The ankh heals its owner if he is close by. Additionally the color of ancient runes around the ankh shows the team of the current owner. The ankh can be destroyed by every player.

Additionally the color of ancient runes around the ankh shows the team of the current owner. The ankh can be destroyed by every player. 
roledesc.description.pirate_captain=he Pirate is a mercenary, who always fights for the player, which owns his contract.  The Pirate Captain spawns with an item called the ‘Contract’. The Contract doesn’t have any direct abilities. It is, however, what binds the Pirates to another player: If the Captain throws the Contract and it gets picked up by someone, all Pirates are automatically on the same team as this person, their 'master'. The Pirates doesn’t gain the teammate's abilities, but they can follow his orders and basically becomes somewhat of a sidekick  However, since the Contract is what binds the Pirates to his team: When the master dies, the Contract is dropped. Whoever picks it up will be the Pirates new boss. But there is another clue: if the Captain dies the Contract gets removed and a new Captain is designated among the Pirates. The new Captain is not bound to the vows his predecessor made and can search for a new master on his own.

The new Captain is not bound to the vows his predecessor made and can search for a new master on his own. 
roledesc.description.priest=The priest plays in the innocent team and his role is hidden like most other roles too. He has one very powerful tool: the holy deagle. With the use of said tool, he can create a powerful brotherhood of innocent players. Players inside the brotherhood see each other in the scoreboard. But he has to be careful, there are a few things to keep in mind: most innocent players are added to the brotherhood, except detectives and sniffers since it is too easy to confirm them shooting a detective or sniffer with the holy deagle deals 30 damage to them shooting an infected host or necromancer kills the infected host or necromancer, the same goes for sidekicks shooting other evil roles kills the priest shooting a marker will mark the whole brotherhood if the priest is converted to an infected, zombie (necromancer) or sidekick, all other members of the brotherhood are converted too while only innocent players can join the brotherhood, players stay in the brotherhood even if they are converted (e.g. jackal, unknown, ...) Additionally the holy deagle has a cooldown after being used. The cooldown is short by default if you missed the target but a higher cooldown is used if you added a player to the brotherhood. 
roledesc.description.serialkiller=The serialkiller plays in his own team and is like the traitor unable to get new team members. He spawns with the tracker item eqipped by default and is therefore able to see the actions of every player though the walls. Additionally he has his own shop but just one credit to buy something. He is not rewarded further credits by killing other players. He can steal credits for dead bodies though. Additinally he starts with an unique knife that helps him to fullfill his mission. 
roledesc.description.sheriff=The sheriff is basically the same as a normal detective. He is visible to the other players, has a shop and fights in the innocent team. However he has a deputydeagle to hire a colleague. Like known from the jackal, he has to fire his shot on any other player to convert their role. The shot player will fight for the team of the sheriff now. His previous team doesn’t matter.  If the Sheriff dies, the deputy will die too (automatically)!  
roledesc.description.deputy=The sheriff is basically the same as a normal detective. He is visible to the other players, has a shop and fights in the innocent team. However he has a deputydeagle to hire a colleague. Like known from the jackal, he has to fire his shot on any other player to convert their role. The shot player will fight for the team of the sheriff now. His previous team doesn’t matter.  If the Sheriff dies, the deputy will die too (automatically)!  
roledesc.description.shinigami=The innocents are now supported by a Shinigami. The Shinigami doesn't know that he is a normal innocent. This one specific innnocent player respawns as a fast walking Shinigami with 200% speed, a knife and a list with all remaining traitors. There's a downside too: the Shinigami looses HP over time and isn't allowed to talk.  Note: When using this with the Deathgrip addon, the Shinigami will never be selected to be in a deathgrip. 
roledesc.description.sidekick=The Sidekick is in the same team as the one who made him his Sidekick. The Sidekick needs to help him to win the game.  There are different modes currently available for a sidekick If a player is shot with the sidekickdeagle of a Jackal, the player becomes his Sidekick If a Jester is killed by a Clairyoyant, the jester is now a Sidekick of the Clairvoyant Depending on a convar, this Sidekick becomes the new master after the death of his master or they are a Sidekick with targets that they have to kill to gather credits for his shop 
roledesc.description.sniffer=The sniffer plays as a normal detective with his role visible to everyone. He is able to see footsteps of every player with the help of his magnifying glass. Additionally he is able to see blood on top of the footsteps of the killer. 
roledesc.description.spectre=The Spectre is an innocent role. When they are killed, they haunt their killer! Their haunt is visible as smoke around their attacker (configurable with ConVars) and when their attacker dies, they revive!  
roledesc.description.spy=The spy is a innocent player with a shop that tries to play alongside the traitors. The traitors see the spy as their colleague, but the spy doesn't know who is a traitor. Therefore the traitors do not know whom to trust. The traitor chat is disabled, when a spy is spawned in the round.  
roledesc.description.glutton=The Glutton is a Traitor role whose hunger acts as their weapon. They have an ever decreasing hunger bar which slowly grants them buffs to their special weapon: Devour. Devour's primary attack is a bite which deals increasing damage based on hunger and its secondary attack allows the Glutton to eat player corpses (at increasing speeds the hungrier they are). Additionally, while holding Devour, the Glutton's movement speed and sprint regeneration increase based on how low their hunger is.  When the Glutton deals damage or eats a corpse with Devour, they regain health and they refill a portion of their hunger bar, always staving off starving! If the Glutton's hunger drops to zero, they will soon turn into the Ravenous!  The Ravenous is no longer on the Traitors' team and must kill everyone else to win! They also lose all their weapons save for their Devour and cannot pick up new weapons. Additionally, they emit a trail of blood-red smoke. 
roledesc.description.ravenous=The Ravenous is a very hungry Glutton (See Glutton).
roledesc.description.survivalist=The survivalist is an enhanced innocent that has his own shop. The shops items can be configured by the server owner and by default is identical to the detective shop.
roledesc.description.vigilante=The Vigilante is a Detective role. Every time you kill a traitor (or enemy neutral role), you increase your damage multiplier. If you kill innocents (or players who are on your team) then your damage multiplier decreases.  
roledesc.description.trapper=The Trapper is at its core an innocent with the powers to detect the traitorous traitor traps. When someone uses a trap, the Trapper gets a visual "ripple" effect where the trap was used. But beware! Also, other trap-users see when the Trapper uses a trap.. (Confusing. but luckily there are convars for that) 
roledesc.description.restless=The Restless is a Neutral killer role. They must kill everyone else to win. What makes them special is they can die multiple times. Every time the Restless is killed, they revive until they run out of lives. With each expended life, they get weaker and take longer to come back to life.  
roledesc.description.unknown=The unknown plays in his own team, but he always loses when surviving till the end. But there's a twist. If he get's killed by another player, he immediately respawns with the role of his killer and helps them to win. This way the unknown and his killer are able to confirm themselves to each other and a strong bond of trust is created. 
roledesc.description.beacon=The beacon is an innocent who becomes more powerful each time someone on their team is confirmed dead. How they are buffed is determined by a series of convars, but by default consists of minor improvements to a slew of stats, including: jump power, speed, damage resistance, damage, fire rate, and health regeneration.  If they accrue enough power, they literally light up and their role is revealed to everyone. This makes them as trustworthy as a detective, but will also alert antagonists to their growing power.  There is but one catch: The beacon mustn't kill someone on their team. If they do, they will become an innocent, and take (potentially lethal) damage. Furthermore, an innocent killer can never become a beacon (ex. an amnesiac who kills the beacon in an attempt to inherit their powers). Such a person becomes an innocent instead.  A final note: The default settings are on the weaker end of the balance spectrum, and exist mostly to show what it can do. Feel free to use the many convars to rebalance the beacon to best fit your server. 
roledesc.description.vampire=The vampire is a new traitor role without a shop that can gain an advantage by transforming and flying around. They have to eliminate at least one other player every minute or else they will fall into a state of Bloodlust in which they take one damage point every two seconds. Whenever they transform into a bat they will also fall into bloodlust.  Additionally a vampire does heal themself for 50% of the damage they deal to other players when they are in bloodlust. 
roledesc.description.lycanthrope=The Lycanthrope is an innocent role with hidden strength. If they become the last player standing on their team, their strength is unleashed! They gain a bonus to their speed, sprint regen, and damage. Additionally, they gain extra health, armor, and their health regenerates.  
roledesc.description.defective=Visually and functionally, the defective operates similarly to a regular detective. They use the detective's shop, have a DNA scanner, and obtain credits in the same manner as a detective. However, they are a traitor: They take up a traitor's spot and a traitor test will reveal them as such. 
roledesc.description.wrath=The Wrath is an addition to the Innocent team, but he's got a twist. If he is ever killed by a fellow innocent he will turn against his former allies. He will be revived after (default 15) seconds as a traitor and has to win with them. However if he dies to any other role that is not part of the innocent team he will die normally. 
roledesc.description.medic=The medic is a new neutral role without a shop who helps everyone with his medigun and the defibrillator. Everyone sees that the person is a medic. He helps traitor and innocent or if he want he can pick a side to support. He can't win and is only a neutral supporter role and not a rambo. But he needs to be careful. If he kills someone then he will loose his equipment and helps the innocent to win. If he kills another medic then he will transform into a traitor. A popup with names will be seen on both events. But don't forget that you have the protection of the Geneva Convention, so if someone kills you his name will be revealed because he did a War Crime. Also it is recommended to only use one medic.  Additionally a medic does heal himself with the medigun equipped and everything is configurable. So don't worry if you don't like this unique neutral supporter role at start. 
roledesc.description.mimic=This addon adds 2 new, similar roles: The Mimic and the Doppelganger.  Both the Mimic and the Doppelganger are able to steal the role of another player during the round. They do this by going up to the player and using the Interact key ("E" by default). After a short, configurable delay, they will change their role into whatever role the targeted player was.  The difference between the Mimic and the Doppelganger is what team their on. The Mimic has no team until they change roles, joining the team of their new role (Innocent for an Innocent roles, Traitor for Traitor roles, etc.). The Doppelganger, on the other hand, is a neutral killer role. They do not join the team of their new role, but instead remain on their own team with the appearance and function of their stolen role. 
roledesc.description.doppelganger=This addon adds 2 new, similar roles: The Mimic and the Doppelganger.  Both the Mimic and the Doppelganger are able to steal the role of another player during the round. They do this by going up to the player and using the Interact key ("E" by default). After a short, configurable delay, they will change their role into whatever role the targeted player was.  The difference between the Mimic and the Doppelganger is what team their on. The Mimic has no team until they change roles, joining the team of their new role (Innocent for an Innocent roles, Traitor for Traitor roles, etc.). The Doppelganger, on the other hand, is a neutral killer role. They do not join the team of their new role, but instead remain on their own team with the appearance and function of their stolen role. 
roledesc.description.blight=The Blight is a simple Traitor role. When killed, the Blight "infects" their attacker, slowly damaging them until they either reach low enough health or until they heal themselves.
